Working with 156 files is one of the easiest and most straightforward things you can
do in Python. It’s also one of the most common things that we need to do, since
programs that don’t interact with the filesystem are rather boring.
 In this chapter, 22 we’ll practice working with files—reading from them, writing to
them, and manipulating the data that they contain. Along the way, you’ll get used
to some of the paradigms that are commonly used when working with Python files,
such as iterating 23 over a file’s contents and writing to files in a with block.
 In some cases, we’ll work with data formatted as CSV (comma-separated values)
or JSON (JavaScript 21 object notation), two common formats that modules in Python’s
standard library handle. If you’ve forgotten the basics of CSV or JSON, I have some
short reminders in this chapter.
